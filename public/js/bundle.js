For example, in case of normal distribution, the highest density is around <em>mean</em>, so mean is the most expected value in this case.</p> <p>CDF function gives you a chance to get a value smaller than given. While the ICDF does the opposite — gives you a value for a given probability.

But if you use Jackknife, then most of the time it will be able to detect that the estimated coefficients are in fact not significant, so statistically they are not distinguishable from zero.</p> <p> In order to investigate this, set polynomial to <em>cubic</em> and take a sample where the last two regression coefficients will be relatively large, so you can see them as small blue bars on the coefficients' plot. Then run the cross-validation procedure and see how all coefficients vary for the local models. At the end you will see errorbars which correspond to 95% confidence intervals and for the non-linear terms, most of the time, the interval will cross zero.</p>"},{id:"asta-b308",title:"Multiple Linear Regression",info:"Multiple Linear Regression.",video:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pVryGi1_K2c",help:'<h2>Multiple linear regression model</h2> <p>This app helps to understand a Multiple Linear Regression model, where a response variable (<em>y</em>) depends on two predictors (<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>) as well as on their interaction. The model is represented by a set of four coefficients, <em>b</em><sub>0</sub> (bias or intercept), <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> (effect of <em>X</em><sub>1</sub>), <em>b</em><sub>2</sub> (effect of <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>) and <em>b</em><sub>12</sub> (effect of interaction between <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>). You can change the values of the coefficients using corresponding controls.</p><p>The model is visualized as a surface in (<em>X</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>y</em>) Cartesian space as it is shown on the 3D plot. The model surface is represented by a two sets of parallel straight lines. One set of lines shows how <em>y</em> depends on <em>X</em><sub>1</sub>, when <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> has different fixed values (one line for each fixed <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>). The second set of lines, which is orthogonal to the first set, shows how <em>y</em> depends on <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> when <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> has different fixed values. You can show both sets or only one of them by using control element "Show lines".</p> <p>The 3D scene can be rotated and zoomed in/out. You can do it with a mouse (drag for rotation and scroll for zooming) or by keyboard (arrows for rotation and "+", "-" for zooming). You can also see a selected point whose X-coordinates you can change. As well as the equation, which shows how y-value of this point is computed using the current model.</p>'},{id:"asta-b309",title:"MLR and colinearity",info:"MLR and colinearity.",video:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iRY8lklHMjc",help:"<h2>Colinearity in MLR</h2><p>This app demonstrates how co-linearity can affect an MLR model. <em>Colinearity</em> is a situation when two or several predictors (<em>x</em>-variables) are correlated (have linear relationship). This can cause some problems when fitting an MLR model, as it implies the lack of correlation among the predictors. If correlation is above moderate, this leads to larger uncertainty between the estimated and expected regression coefficients. But If correlation is high/strong, this can lead to a very large uncertainty and makes the model uninterpretable. In some cases it can even make the fitting impossible.</p><p>The severity of the problem depends on several things. First of all, on how strong the correlation among the predictors is. Usually MLR is stable to weak or moderate correlations. Second factor is the sample size, the smaller number of observations the bigger the uncertainty is. And, finally, it also depends on the fitting error — how well y-values are fitted by the model. In this app you can change all these parameters and then take several samples and see how big will be the uncertainty and how far is the MLR plane from the expected. Start with default settings which gives the best model, take several samples and check how far the regression coefficients of the fitted model are from the expected/theoretical shown with gray bars. Then play with the sample quality parameters and check how do they influence the fitting quality.</p>"}]}];function qe(e,t,o){const n=e.slice();return n[15]=t[o],n}function je(e){let t,n;const i=[e[4],{tab:e[3]}];let a={};for(let e=0;e<i.length;e+=1)a=o(a,i[e]);return t=new Le({props:a}),t.$on("close",e[9]),{c(){se(t.$$.fragment)},m(e,o){re(t,e,o),n=!0},p(e,o){const n=24&o?ie(i,[16&o&&ae(e[4]),8&o&&{tab:e[3]}]):{};t.$set(n)},i(e){n||(ee(t.$$.fragment,e),n=!0)},o(e){te(t.$$.fragment,e),n=!1},d(e){le(t,e)}}}function Ee(e){let t,n;const i=[e[15]];let a={};for(let e=0;e<i.length;e+=1)a=o(a,i[e]);return t=new ke({props:a}),{c(){se(t.$$.fragment)},m(e,o){re(t,e,o),n=!0},p(e,o){const n=2&o?ie(i,[ae(e[15])]):{};t.$set(n)},i(e){n||(ee(t.$$.fragment,e),n=!0)},o(e){te(t.$$.fragment,e),n=!1},d(e){le(t,e)}}}function Re(e){let t,o,n,i,s,r,l,h,c,p,u,d,m,w=e[2]&&e[4]&&je(e),b=e[1].filter(Me),S=[];for(let t=0;t<b.length;t+=1)S[t]=Ee(qe(e,b,t));const A=e=>te(S[e],1,1,(()=>{S[e]=null}));return{c(){w&&w.c(),t=x(),o=k("div"),n=k("input"),i=x(),s=k("button"),s.textContent="×",r=x(),l=k("span"),h=T(e[5]),c=x();for(let e=0;e<S.length;e+=1)S[e].c();p=T(""),I(n,"placeholder","Enter a single keyword (e.g. interval)"),I(n,"class","svelte-12lrilt"),I(s,"class","svelte-12lrilt"),z(s,"hidden",e[0].length<1),I(l,"class","svelte-12lrilt"),I(o,"class","search-block svelte-12lrilt")},m(a,b){w&&w.m(a,b),v(a,t,b),v(a,o,b),f(o,n),H(n,e[0]),f(o,i),f(o,s),f(o,r),f(o,l),f(l,h),v(a,c,b);for(let e=0;e<S.length;e+=1)S[e].m(a,b);v(a,p,b),u=!0,d||(m=[$(window,"load",e[7]),$(window,"hashchange",e[7]),$(n,"keydown",e[6]),$(n,"input",e[10]),$(s,"click",e[11])],d=!0)},p(e,[o]){if(e[2]&&e[4]?w?(w.p(e,o),20&o&&ee(w,1)):(w=je(e),w.c(),ee(w,1),w.m(t.parentNode,t)):w&&(G(),te(w,1,1,(()=>{w=null})),Z()),1&o&&n.value!==e[0]&&H(n,e[0]),1&o&&z(s,"hidden",e[0].length<1),(!u||32&o)&&C(h,e[5]),2&o){let t;for(b=e[1].filter(Me),t=0;t<b.length;t+=1){const n=qe(e,b,t);S[t]?(S[t].p(n,o),ee(S[t],1)):(S[t]=Ee(n),S[t].c(),ee(S[t],1),S[t].m(p.parentNode,p))}for(G(),t=b.length;t<S.length;t+=1)A(t);Z()}},i(e){if(!u){ee(w);for(let e=0;e<b.length;e+=1)ee(S[e]);u=!0}},o(e){te(w),S=S.filter(Boolean);for(let e=0;e<S.length;e+=1)te(S[e]);u=!1},d(e){w&&w.d(e),e&&g(t),e&&g(o),e&&g(c),y(S,e),e&&g(p),d=!1,a(m)}}}const Me=e=>e.apps.length>0;function Ne(e,t,o){let n,i,a,s,r=!1,l="",h="";function c(e,t){o(4,s=function(e){const t=De.map((t=>({apps:t.apps.filter((t=>"#"+t.id===e))}))).filter((e=>e.apps.length>0));return 0===t.length||0===t[0].apps.length?null:t[0].apps[0]}(e)),s?(["app","video","info"].includes(t)||(t="app"),"video"==t&&""===s.video&&(t="app"),o(2,r=!0),o(3,l=t||"app"),document.querySelector("body").style.overflow="hidden"):location.hash=""}function p(e){document.querySelector("body").style.overflow="auto",o(2,r=!1),location.hash="",o(3,l=""),o(4,s=void 0)}function u(e){void 0!==e&&"Escape"!==e.key||o(0,h="")}return e.$$.update=()=>{1&e.$$.dirty&&o(1,n=h.length>1?De.map((e=>({title:e.title,apps:e.apps.filter((e=>e.title.toLowerCase().search(h.toLowerCase())>=0|e.info.toLowerCase().search(h.toLowerCase())>=0))}))):De),2&e.$$.dirty&&o(8,i=n.reduce(((e,t)=>parseInt(e)+t.apps.length),0)),257&e.$$.dirty&&o(5,a=h.length>0?`Found ${i} app${i>1?"s":""}`:`${i} apps in the list.`)},[h,n,r,l,s,a,u,function(){if(""===location.hash)return void(r&&p());const e=location.hash.split("/"),t=e[0],o=e[1];""!==t?c(t,o):r&&p()},i,()=>location.hash="",function(){h=this.value,o(0,h)},()=>u(void 0)]}return new class extends pe{constructor(e){super(),ce(this,e,Ne,Re,r,{})}}({target:document.getElementById("app-list")})}();
